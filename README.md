ReUsability Support System for E-Learning. Releases can be found at following site: http://build.eduworks.com/dist/russel-ui/

RUSSEL is a web site built in GWT to act as a state of the art repository for e-learning content, and to support workflows common in repurposing content, using common instructional strategies, into new packages for use in education.

RUSSEL also acts as a repository for several projects, including DECALS, TRADEM, and PULSAR, supporting flexible metadata formats and providing customization capabilities for the various workflows involved in rapid e-learning content development.

* Web services enabled for use with LEVR or your CMS (with customization).
* Supports file upload, search, modification, and curation, including comments and ratings.
* User based security is provided, with user management coming soon.
* Metadata fields are available for use, primarily specialized towards military use, but can easily be adapted to corporate use.
* Fully functional content repurposing workflow, featuring alignment of content with Gagne's Nine Events and export into a SCORM package.
